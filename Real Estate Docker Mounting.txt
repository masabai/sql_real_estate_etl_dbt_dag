Project Note: Docker Mounting & Current Setup
<When you run ariflow/dag>
1. remove comments from docker-compose.yml as follows
2. comment out PG Admin
The Docker volume mounting paths for DAGs have been commented out in the current docker-compose.yml.
Effect: Docker will not use or create the 18+ GB folder in the PyCharm working directory.
A backup of the original YAML is kept in place for reference.
Only change in the current YAML: the DAG directory mount is commented out.
Current functionality:
Able to access Postgres / PG Admin
Airflow UI and DAG execution are not available (because DAGs are not mounted).
Able to continue testing dbt run/build using the Airflow database.


NOTE:
remove comments from PG Admin in docker-compose.yml
docker inspect -f '{{.HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name}}' pgadmin
return -> no
reset as follows
docker update --restart=always pgadmin
docker inspect -f '{{.HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name}}' pgadmin
return -> always
